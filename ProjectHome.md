# The DIY Keyboard Project #

The DIY Keyboard open source hardware project aims to enable do-it-yourselfers to build their own digital pianos and keyboards.  Since excellent digital pianos with a traditional key layout are already available on the market, the main motivation for doing this is to support alternative key layouts.  See the wiki for more details.
