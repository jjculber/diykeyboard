Keyboard Design Decisions for Drew's first keyboard prototype:

Design Goals for the keyboard as a whole:

* The keyboard must support the playing of traditional piano music.

* This is a design for a Janko keyboard in the full sense of the word.  This implies:
	* There are multiple touchpoints per key, all of which sound the same pitch.
	* The rows of touchpoints are tiered to support half-step chord slides and thumb usage on rows above the first.
	* The geometry and movement of the touchpoints should be as uniform as practical.

* All part CAD models are generated parametrically by scripts, so that:
	* Individual builders can tune the geometric parameters to their liking.
	* It is easier for community members to merge their refinements into the mainstream design.
	* The design can be easily versioned and distributed via a SVN repository.

* At minimum, all ergonomically important parameters, including the number of rows of touch-points, must be configurable by the user.

* Key modules must be able to be assembled and serviced individually, to allow for easier prototyping, and to allow a keyboard of any multiple of the module size to be constructed.

* Keys and key caps are one part to reduce the part count and improve key rigidity.
	Ramification: Due to overlap of key caps with key bodies, the key bed must split for key module removal.
			In the worst case, half of the modules will have to be unscrewed from the chassis.

* The keys must be velocity sensitive, and support repeated legato notes without damper pedal.

* The non-off-the shelf parts must be able to be fabricated by the user as much as possible.  
	* As many parts resin-castable as possible
	* Design the PCB with as few layers as possible, even if it requires jumpering some traces, prefer through-hole parts.

More Specific Implementation Decisions:

* It must be impossible to pinch your fingers in-between or under a key cap (overhangs not acceptable).

* To reduce part count and simplify key supports, the keys rotate around a fulcrum.  (Future designs may transition to a parallelogram linkage to make touchpoint movement more uniform)

* For return mechanism, coil springs are used in tension, to simplify part finding and spring positioning. (As opposed to using leaf springs, or coil springs in compression).  In future prototypes a gravity-driven mechanism may be used for a feel that is a little more like a piano, a little less like a synth.

* Don't program plastic-reducing cutouts; the user can probably do a better job by hand anyway, dimensions are not critical, and this will be a rather fun, creative task.  Perhaps as the final step, the user defined cavities can be subtracted from the rest of the part.

* Key version imprinted in the side of the key could be useful in the long run.

* (?) Same part can be used for all three key guides and fulcrum.

* Different thicknesses of felt for upper stop, lower stop, lateral alignment.

Electronics:

* Top mounted electronics could make reprogramming module firmware more convenient, and make it easier to test the scanner circuit on a 7-5 keyboard.

* Key scanning done optically to give a lot of flexibility in how velocity and note off are computed.
	* Can enable repeated legato note playing without using the damper pedal
	* Other hacks to increase the key repeat rate, in the same spirit that mechanical hacks do in real pianos.
	* Aftertouch for the synthheads
	* Non-contact sensing; no contacts to corrode or wear.

* Key scanner electronics modular at the same granularity as the key modules.
	* Easier prototyping, debugging.
	* Users can build a keyboard of any size, mod 8.
