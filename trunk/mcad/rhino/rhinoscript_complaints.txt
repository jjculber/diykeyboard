Rhinoscript Complaints

This is a place to vent frustration at Rhino/Vbscript/Rhinoscript, which despite being a market leader, is often infuriating to use.
(Some of these should probably be written up as bug reports)

Vbscript is way too verbose for programming geometry...
	i.e. verbose vbscript variable naming conventions, i.e. strObjectName dblSomeVariable
	i.e. having to write "Call" to call a function
	i.e. having to write "Array" to create an array, instead of that being buit into the syntax
	i.e. variables can not be initialized at declaration, i.e. you have to Dim strlongVariableName : strlongVariableName = "Fuck Vbscript"
	
Dividing by a variable that has not even been initialized yet fails silently, resulting in cryptic errors elsewhere in your code.

There seems to be no consistency in the API w.r.t. whether functions return arrays of objects or just a single object.

The Monkey Editor stays on top, no matter what, forcing you to maximize and minimize the window to see the results of your script.

Errors often pop up in a window instead of just showing up in the console (like is standard in just about every other IDE ever made)

The little error window often gets written over due to a rendering glitch, preventing you from seeing the actual error.

The error string if often un-helpul even if you make it past the last three hurdles.

The built-in rhinoscript editor doesn't proide a visual indication of the save state of your document
