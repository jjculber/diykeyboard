#summary Different Options for Key Layout

The actual arrangement of the keys can have a significant impact on how difficult it is to learn to play a keyboard instrument, and what musical styles are possible even for those skilled at the instrument.

=The Traditional 5-7 layout=
This is the key layout that currently dominates western music.  Your acoustic piano almost certainly has this layout.  The standard music staff has this layout.  The names by which you refer to notes even have this layout.  A C major scale can be played on all white keys.  

=The Janko 6-6 layout=
The Janko layout is the alternative layout that is most similar to the traditional layout.  Keys increase linearly by half-steps as on a traditional piano.  Multiple touch-points are provided on each key.  The touch-points overlap adjacent keys horizontally and alternate rows vertically.  
This layout confers the following advantages:
 * Transposition can be performed simply by starting on a different key, reducing the number of scales, etc. to be learned by a factor of 12 over the 5-7 layout.
 * For the same key width, the octave span is slightly smaller, making large intervals easier to play.
 * All chords can be slid up or down by half step intervals, up until the front-most touch point is reached.
