#summary Info on different key switches MOVED

MOVING TO SOURCEFORGE!!!

Key switches provide the interface between the mechanical and the electrical portions of the piano.  

== RubberMembraneKeyswitches ==
The vast majority of commercial keyboards use rubber membrane key-switches.  While these are one of the most inexpensive technologies to mass-produce since the switches for many keys are effectively stamped into one part, they have a limited lifetime, and are typically one of the first things to fail in commercial keyboards.

== OpticalKeyswitches ==
LED/Photodiode pairs are more reliable than rubber keyswitches, and are already seem to be the for retrofitting acoustic pianos with digital technology.  

== ConductingSpringSwitch ==

== MagneticKeyswitches ==
Magnetic switches (hall effect sensors).  Hall effect sensors are four terminal devices.  If put a current across the chip in one direction, an applied magnetic field will alter the trajectory of the moving electrons, resulting in a measurable voltage potential across the other two pins.  While these can be as cheap as optical sensors, it is a lot harder to prevent magnetic interference between keys than it is to prevent optical interference.  

== CapacitiveKeyswitches ==
The major drawback of capacitive switches is that they require a rather high voltage bus in order to have good noise immunity.
