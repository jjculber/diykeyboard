#summary The mechanical keybed action.

The action of the keybed is what provides the mechanical interface between the musician's fingers and the keyboard.  At one extreme the action could be as simple as a momentary pushbutton switch.  At the other extreme would be a full grand piano action with about 5-10 moving parts.  There is a tradeoff that must be struck between complexity, cost, comfort, and playing precision.  

Most mass-produced electronic keyboards are one of two varieties: 
 # A synth action where the key is a single lever with negligible momentum.  
 # A digital piano action with a second lever (the hammer) to add momentum and sometimes escapement.  Yamaha and Fatar are the largest manufacturers of this style of keybed.  Yamaha and Fatar keybeds are used by most of the major keyboard manufactureres.
