#summary Information for building a keyboard scanner circuit.

= Introduction =
The key scanning circuit provides the electronic interface between the key switches and the micro-controller.  Digital keyboards have many key switches.  At least 88*2 are required for a velocity sensitive standard piano layout, and many experimental designs call for many more.  Most microcontrollers have on the order of 10-20 digital I/O pins, so some scanning circuitry is necessary for all but the most trivial keyboards.

== Useful Parts ==
SN74LS138N is the only DIP 3->8 pin decoder on digikey.  Nice old school TTL logic family chip.

I'm really happy with the atmel atmega168 that I started using thanks to the excellent work of the [http://www.arduino.cc  arduino project], which is a cheaper and easier to use branch of the [http://www.wiring.org.co/ Wiring Project].  The standard board can be programmed over USB, and it has a cross-platform IDE that really just works, even in OS X!
